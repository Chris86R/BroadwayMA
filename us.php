                <p class="mb-5"><b>Easter Egg Hunt:</b> Our 1 st Annual Easter Egg Hunt will take place on April 4 th at 2:30pm in the
Playground Area of PS274 (a flier has been attached to advertise the event). Attendees decided to
host it on Friday April 6 th as opposed to April 1 st as many families will be busy during that date.
However, many of the people committed to make this event occur will not be available on April 6 th
so our event was moved up to accommodate these merchants and orgs.<br>
The following materials/items will be needed in preparation for the event:
<li>500 hollow eggs</li>
<li>400 egg collecting bags/baskets</li>
<li>100 water bottles and 10 twelve-fluid oz juices (with cups)</li>
<li>Chalk; face paint; hula hoops, potato sacks and eggs (to play an egg or potato sack race)</li>
<li>A dozen balloons</li>
<li>Camera and photographer to have kids take pic w/ Easter Bunny</li>
<b><big>Any</big></b> and all donations are appreciated and if you would like to do so for this event please
contact Egaudy Gomez or Boris Santos**<br>
<b>1 st Annual Block Festivals:</b> We will be hosting two block parties in the Summer; one to take place
in July (date will be announced as the original date has to be rescheduled) and the other on
September 1 st . The 1 st Block Festival will emphasize personal and mental health as we begin the
summer and want to do so by offering as many health-related resources and forms of
entertainment as possible. The 2 nd Block Festival will be used to help get our Bushwick and
Bedstuy students get ready for the 2018-2019 School Year.

Currently, we are taking any ideas that merchants, residents, and organizational members want to
see take please during the Block Festival. Egaudy and I will be taking in ideas for the July Block
Festival up until July 1 st , 2018. Also, we plan on accepting ideas for the September Block Festival
until August 15 th , 2018. We have attached a list of orgs that have signed up to table and/or do
some fun-filled activity along the corridor. Below is a list of ideas that were shared with us during
the March meeting:
                    <li>Should include water dunk tanks (at each end of festival; police officers to be dunked)</li>
                    <li>Zumba and Yoga should take place on artificial turf</li>
                    <li>Whiffle ball game in PS274 schoolyard</li>
                    <li>Food eating contest of some sort (cannoli?) – sponsored by merchants</li>
<li>Smoothies or only healthy food options (provided from Mr. Kiwis or Buntopia?) should be
    offered during July (Health-Related) Festival</li>
<li>Create Mural to commemorate the Block Party during days of Festival (can begin creating the
mural during 1 st festival and then eventually finish – doesn’t have to happen during same day)
